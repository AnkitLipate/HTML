            A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ ⓘ WIK-ee) is an online hypertext publication 
            collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience, using 
            a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the 
            subjects or scope of the project, and could be either open to 
            the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining 
            its internal knowledge base.

            Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki 
            engines. A wiki engine, being a form of a content management 
            system, differs from other web-based systems such as blog 
            software, in that the content is created without any defined 
            owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, 
            allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the 
            users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written 
            using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with 
            the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of 
            different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of 
            other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines
             are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. 
             Some permit control over different functions (levels of access);
              for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or 
              removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing 
              access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content.
